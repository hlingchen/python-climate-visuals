Matplotlib is a comprehensive library for creating static, animated, and interactive visualizations in Python. It is a multi-platform data visualization library built on NumPy arrays and designed to work with the broader SciPy stack. It was conceived by John Hunter in 2002, originally as a patch to IPython for enabling interactive MATLAB-style plotting via gnuplot from the IPython command line.

```{admonition} Matplotlib capabilities
* **CREATE**: Develop publication quality plots with just a few lines of code.
* **CUSTOMIZE**: Take full control of line styles, font properties, axes properties, and so on.
* **INTERACT**: Use interactive figures that can zoom, pan, and update; export and embed to a number of file formats and interactive environments.
* **EXTEND**: Explore tailored functionality provided by third party packages.
* **CROSS-PLATFORM**: Support many operating systems and graphics backends.
* **OPEN-SOURCE**: Matplotlib is developed and maintained [publicly on GitHub](https://github.com/matplotlib/matplotlib) by a vibrant, responsive, and diverse community.
