NumPy is the fundamental package for scientific computing in Python. 

It is a Python library that provides a multidimensional array object, 
various derived objects (such as masked arrays and matrices), and an assortment of routines 
for fast operations on arrays, including mathematical, logical, shape manipulation, sorting, 
selecting, I/O, discrete Fourier transforms, basic linear algebra, basic statistical operations, random simulation and much more.

```{admonition} NumPy features/capabilities
* **POWERFUL N-DIMENSIONAL ARRAYS**: A fast and efficient DataFrame object for data manipulation with integrated indexing;
* **NUMERICAL COMPUTING TOOLS**: NumPy offers comprehensive mathematical functions, random number generators, linear algebra routines, Fourier transforms, and more.
* **INTEROPERABLE**: NumPy supports a wide range of hardware and computing platforms, and plays well with distributed, GPU, and sparse array libraries.
* **PERFORMANT**: The core of NumPy is well-optimized C code. Enjoy the flexibility of Python with the speed of compiled code.
* **EASY TO USE**: NumPyâ€™s high level syntax makes it accessible and productive for programmers from any background or experience level.
* **OPEN SOURCE**: Distributed under a liberal [BSD license](https://github.com/numpy/numpy/blob/main/LICENSE.txt), NumPy is developed and maintained 
   [publicly on GitHub](https://github.com/numpy/numpy) by a vibrant, responsive, and diverse [community](https://numpy.org/community/).
